# Overview

As a software engineer, I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge in various programming languages. This project serves as a means to further my learning in C# by developing a console-based Employee Management System.

## Description

The software I wrote is an Employee Management System implemented in C#. It allows users to add, edit, and display employee details. The system supports two types of employees: permanent and temporary. Permanent employees have a fixed salary, while temporary employees are paid based on hourly rates and hours worked.

## Purpose

The purpose of writing this software is to deepen my understanding of the C# programming language, particularly focusing on its syntax, object-oriented features, and file I/O operations. By building a practical application like an Employee Management System, I aimed to apply various language concepts in a real-world scenario.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Visual Studio as my integrated development environment (IDE). Visual Studio provides a comprehensive set of tools for C# development, including code editing, debugging, and project management.

I utilized C# as the programming language for this project. Additionally, I made use of .NET Framework libraries for file I/O operations and basic console input/output functionalities.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, I found the following websites helpful:

- [Microsoft Documentation for C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [C# Corner](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/)

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to enhance the Employee Management System by implementing the following improvements and additions:

- Implementing user authentication and authorization for secure access to employee data.
- Adding functionality for calculating and processing employee benefits such as leave accrual and allowances.
- Enhancing the user interface with a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
- Optimizing the code for better performance and scalability, especially for managing a large number of employees.
